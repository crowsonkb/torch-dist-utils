Module torch_dist_utils
-----------------------

Before using ``torch_dist_utils`` functions, you must either call :func:`torch_dist_utils.init_distributed()` or initialize the default process group yourself. :func:`torch_dist_utils.init_distributed()` can be called even if you did not start the script with ``torchrun``: if you did not, it will assume it is the only process and create a process group with a single member.
